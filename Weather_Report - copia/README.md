# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## OpenAI API Key

This project includes a simple helper that calls the OpenAI Chat Completions API to provide a conversational "Reporte personalizado". To use it during development you must provide an OpenAI API key.

1. Locally (Node / development builds): set the environment variable before starting Expo:

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..." ; npm run start
```

2. With Expo config or secrets: you can inject the key into your native build config or use a secure secrets manager for production builds. Do NOT hard-code the key into your source.

Security note: embedding the OpenAI API key in a client-side app (Expo Go or distributed builds) can expose it to end users. For production, run the OpenAI calls from a secure server (or serverless function) and have the app communicate with your backend.
